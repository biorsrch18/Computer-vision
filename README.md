ðŸŒ± Plant Seedlings Classification using Deep Learning

ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project utilizes computer vision and Deep Learning to automate the classification of plant seedlings into 12 distinct species using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. By leveraging image data, preprocessing techniques, and neural network architectures, this model aims to reduce manual labor in agriculture, improving efficiency and accuracy in plant identification.

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Despite advances in agri-tech, manual identification of plant species remains labor-intensive. This project proposes a CNN-based solution to classify seedlings, aiming to: automatically

1. Reduce human effort in identifying plants
2. Increase classification accuracy
3. Enable scalable and sustainable crop monitoring solutions

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. Build an end-to-end pipeline to classify images of plant seedlings
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Implement preprocessing steps like resizing, denoising, and normalization
4. Train, validate, and evaluate a CNN model
